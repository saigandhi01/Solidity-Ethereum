Hello

Solidity basics: You will start with the basics of Solidity, learning about variables and how to build a basic calculator contract.

Blockchain deployment: Learn how to deploy your Solidity contracts to a blockchain.

Deep dive into Solidity: You will explore in depth topics like mappings, arrays, structs, require statements, modifiers, and events.

Build a Twitter Contract: Step-by-step, you will build a Twitter contract, adding features like structs, limiting tweet lengths, adding likes, and more.

Integrate with a DApp: You will learn how to integrate your Twitter contract into a DApp.

Advanced Solidity concepts: Towards the end of the course, you will learn about loops, contract inheritance, and contract-to-contract interaction.

Final Project: At the end of the course, you will add user profiles to your Twitter contract, and also add account creation functionality to your DApp.
